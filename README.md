# eeg-emotion-analysis

This study makes use of the DEAP dataset, and machine learning models to perform EEG-based emotion classification. To perform emotion recognition using EEG signals I used machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM) and used the OpenFace software to collect our ground truth for the machine learning algorithms. 

For EEG based emotion recognition in this project, we used machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM).
